# NFT-Gallery

Create an NFT gallery by querying blockchain data. Enter the wallet and collection addresses of the NFTs you would like to fetch, and the collection will appear! This application will allow you to query blockchain databases, using the Alchemy API to connect to the blockchain and create an NFT Gallery through the handling of metadata.
